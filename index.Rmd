# Teach Me How to Google
### *What do to when your code stops working or you're still in the process of figuring out what code to even write (or both)*

## Some Intro stuff

we all need help with our code -- whether it's figuring out if there's a function that does what we want or trying to troubleshoot a pesky error message. No one is exempt from this (show tweets)

There are 2 types needing help:

    1. You got an error and you need to know how to fix it
    2. You are trying to figure out how to do something

---
## General approaches (non-error)

need to know vocabulary

---
## General apporaches (error message)

    1.  check the easy things (have a check list)
    2.  run line by line (if pipes)
    3.  GOOGLE (error message, function name, etc.)
        a. Check out function/package source code on GitHub (Jenny Bryan's tweet)
        b. [r] in front of search phrase or package + search phrase
        c. check dates on stack overflow responses

---
## Check off the easy things first

- this often goes hand-in-hand with isolating the problem

## Knowing *what* to search for is half the battle

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">The early hard part is just knowing the vocabulary. True beginners would have no reason to know what a join is. They might describe it as “looking up values from another table” which may not produce helpful results. So reading through a text book or intro class can give vocab</p>&mdash; JD Long (@CMastication) <a href="https://twitter.com/CMastication/status/1437827181476995072?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">September 14, 2021</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">That vocabulary then becomes the enabler for good searching. And I wish I had a better (faster) way to ramp up their vocab.</p>&mdash; JD Long (@CMastication) <a href="https://twitter.com/CMastication/status/1437827413459755009?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">September 14, 2021</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

## Use **search operators** to get more specific results

## Ways to write good, eas(ier) to debug code

use explaining variables!
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Great post on why &quot;explaining variables&quot; and &quot;explaining functions or methods&quot; are better than code comments.<br><br>I found that my enthusiasm for writing/maintaining comments peaked many years ago and I&#39;m better off using other techniques to make the non-obvious (more) obvious. <a href="https://t.co/yIIOnd8qHz">https://t.co/yIIOnd8qHz</a></p>&mdash; Jenny Bryan (@JennyBryan) <a href="https://twitter.com/JennyBryan/status/1412140590842597385?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">July 5, 2021</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
