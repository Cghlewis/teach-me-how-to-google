### Welcome to data science, where questions are aplenty!

.pull-left[

`r fontawesome::fa("angle-right", fill = "#05859B", a11y = "sem")` You will become increasingly more comfortable with **not immediately knowing** the answers to all your coding problems. It's all part of the job.

<br>

`r fontawesome::fa("angle-right", fill = "#05859B", a11y = "sem")` If it's not already, **Google** will become one of your best friends.

<br>

`r fontawesome::fa("angle-right", fill = "#05859B", a11y = "sem")` Googling is hard, and it is a skill that requries **practice.** But you **can** and **will** get better at it over time.

```{r, out.width = '120%', echo = FALSE, fig.alt = "A gif of Seth Meyers sitting at the desk of his show, Late Night, and saying 'I have a lot of questions.'"}

```
]
.pull-right[

<span style = 'font-size: 85%;'>-Me, everytime I open RStudio</span>
]
]

 ### It doesn't mean you won't still feel like this at times:
 
.center2[
```{r, out.width = '100%', out.height = '100%', echo = FALSE, fig.alt = "A gif of Ron Swanson, from the comedy TV series, Parks and Recreation, getting angry at his computer then taking it outside to toss in a dumpster."}
knitr::include_graphics("media/ron_swanson.gif")
```
.center[
<span style = 'font-size: 85%;'>-Me still, about half the times I open RStudio</span>
]
]

---

### But the goal is to be a bit more at peace with that feeling...and have the confidence that you can find your way

<br>

.center2[
```{r, out.width = '100%', echo = FALSE, fig.alt = "A cartoon drawing of an x- and y-axis plot, where the x-axis represents 'time' and the y-axis represents 'how much I know about R'. A round cartoon creature is moving through time (i.e. to the right across the x-axis). At time point one, when this creature is first beginning to learn R, it knows very little and it's facial expression suggests that it feels very intimidated. Over time, it experiences some highs and some lows. At time point eight (which is the furthest point to the right along the x-axis) this creature again feels like it knows very little about R, but instead of seeming intimidated as it did at time point one, it appears to be excited, suggesting a new sense of confidence."}

<br>

--
  
  <span style = 'font-size: 120%;'>`r fontawesome::fa("flushed", fill = "#05859B", a11y = "sem")` Sometimes, it's both of these things happening at the same time</span>

Common reason why things get funky in a way that makes it difficult to debug and understand. The good thing is that you don't have to. Quit, restart!

This is often referred to as **rubber duck debugging**, and it goes something like this:

> <span style = 'font-size: 55%;'>*1. Beg, borrow, steal, buy, fabricate or otherwise obtain a rubber duck (bathtub variety).*</span> 

> <span style = 'font-size: 55%;'>*2. Place rubber duck on desk and inform it you are just going to go over some code with it, if that’s all right.*</span>

> <span style = 'font-size: 55%;'>*3. Explain to the duck what your code is supposed to do, and then go into detail and explain your code **line by line**.*</span> 

> <span style = 'font-size: 55%;'>*4. At some point you will tell the duck what you are doing next and then realise that that is not in fact what you are actually doing. The duck will sit there serenely, happy in the knowledge that it has helped you on your way.*</span>

  - <span style = 'font-size: 100%;'>error message + function or package name</span>
  - <span style = 'font-size: 100%;'>sometimes even just the error message alone with suffice</span>

--

<span style = 'font-size: 120%;'>`r fontawesome::fa("github-square", fill = "#05859B", a11y = "sem")`  Explore package source code on GitHub</span>
 
  - <span style = 'font-size: 100%;'>this may include looking at any issues or pull requests associated with that package to check if there are known problems (e.g. check out `dplyr` on [GitHub](https://github.com/tidyverse/dplyr))</span>

<span style = 'font-size: 120%;'>`r fontawesome::fa("calendar", fill = "#05859B", a11y = "sem")`  Check the date of online solutions</span>

**Re: Google-fu:**
- Reminder: anytime you get an unusually cryptic error message, it doesn't hurt to just cut-n-paste a reasonably-specific chunk of the message into Google.

- For example, one of you contacted me about an error message whose last line was: `function 'Rcpp_precious_remove' not provided by package 'Rcpp'`

- That looked reasonably-specific (i.e., likely to retrieve something useful, and unlikely to retrieve cat memes), so I Googled it: https://www.google.com/search?q=function+%27Rcpp_precious_remove%27+not+provided+by+package+%27Rcpp%27

- First hit was: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/68416435/rcpp-package-doesnt-include-rcpp-precious-remove which solved the problem.

## `r fontawesome::fa("list", fill = "#05859B", a11y = "sem")`  Perhaps a curated vocabulary list could help?

  - Hadley Wickham lists functions that he believes constitute a good working vocabulary for R fluency in his book, [Advanced R (first edition)](http://adv-r.had.co.nz/Vocabulary.html). 

  - I would love to expand on this, with a focus on data wrangling and visualization. Ping me with ideas! 
  
  - In the meantime, keeping a running vocab list for yourself might be massively helpful
