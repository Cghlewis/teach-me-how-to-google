### Welcome to data science, where questions are aplenty!

.pull-left[

`r fontawesome::fa("angle-right", fill = "#05859B", a11y = "sem")` You will become increasingly more comfortable with **not immediately knowing** the answers to a plethora of coding problems. It's all part of the job.

<br>

`r fontawesome::fa("angle-right", fill = "#05859B", a11y = "sem")` If it's not already, **Google** will become one of your best friends.

<br>

`r fontawesome::fa("angle-right", fill = "#05859B", a11y = "sem")` Googling is hard, and it is a skill that requries **practice.** But you **can** and **will** get better at it over time.

```{r, out.width = '120%', echo = FALSE, fig.alt = "A gif of Seth Meyers sitting at the desk of his show, Late Night, and saying 'I have a lot of questions.'"}

```

<span style = 'font-size: 85%;'>-Me, everytime I open RStudio</span>

 ### It doesn't mean you won't still feel like this at times:
 
.center2[
```{r, out.width = '100%', out.height = '100%', echo = FALSE, fig.alt = "A gif of Ron Swanson, from the comedy TV series, Parks and Recreation, getting angry at his computer then taking it outside to toss in a dumpster."}
knitr::include_graphics("media/ron_swanson.gif")
```
.center[
<span style = 'font-size: 85%;'>-Me still, about half the times I open RStudio</span>
]
]

---
### But the goal is to be a bit more at peace with that feeling...and have the confidence that you can find your way

.center2[
```{r, out.width = '100%', echo = FALSE, fig.alt = "A cartoon drawing of an x- and y-axis plot, where the x-axis represents 'time' and the y-axis represents 'how much I know about R'. A round cartoon creature is moving through time (i.e. to the right across the x-axis). At time point one, when this creature is first beginning to learn R, it knows very little and it's facial expression suggests that it feels very intimidated. Over time, it experiences some highs and some lows. At time point eight (which is the furthest point to the right along the x-axis) this creature again feels like it knows very little about R, but instead of seeming intimidated as it did at time point one, it appears to be excited, suggesting a new sense of confidence."}

### I typically find myself turning to Google for one of two reasons:

<br>

  <span style = 'font-size: 120%;'>`r fontawesome::fa("exclamation-triangle", fill = "#05859B", a11y = "sem")`  I got an error and need help fixing it</span>
  
  <br>
  
  <span style = 'font-size: 120%;'>`r fontawesome::fa("question-circle", fill = "#05859B", a11y = "sem")` I know what I want my code to do, but I have no idea how to actually pull it off</span>
  
<br>

--
  
  <span style = 'font-size: 120%;'>`r fontawesome::fa("flushed", fill = "#05859B", a11y = "sem")` Sometimes, it's both of these things happening at the same time</span>
  
---

### Before jumping straight to Google: pause, exhale, take care of the simple things first

<br>

--

<span style = 'font-size: 120%;'>`r fontawesome::fa("power-off", fill = "#05859B", a11y = "sem")`  Restart R</span>

--

<br>

<span style = 'font-size: 120%;'>`r fontawesome::fa("lightbulb", fill = "#05859B", a11y = "sem")`  Check the easy stuff</span>

--

<br>


<span style = 'font-size: 120%;'>`r fontawesome::fa("exclamation-triangle", fill = "#05859B", a11y = "sem")`  Read that error message!</span>

--

<br>

<span style = 'font-size: 120%;'>`r fontawesome::fa("file-alt", fill = "#05859B", a11y = "sem")`  Double-check the documentation</span>

--

<br>

<span style = 'font-size: 120%;'>`r fontawesome::fa("earlybirds", fill = "#05859B", a11y = "sem")`  Talk about it out load</span>

## Restart R

Sometimes this really does work. See Jenny Bryan's video:

>"Restart R often, espcially when things get weird." 

-Jenny Bryan, in her 2020 RSTUDIO::CONF keynote, [Object of type ‘closure’ is not subsettable](https://www.rstudio.com/resources/rstudioconf-2020/object-of-type-closure-is-not-subsettable/)

"We install and update packages from R, which is a little bit like working on your airplane engine while you're flying"

paraphrased: Common reason why things get funky in a way that makes it difficult to debug and understand. The good thing is that you don't have to. Quit, restart!

## Check off the easy things first

???
- this often goes hand-in-hand with isolating the problem

# Isolate the problem (line-by-line)

## OLD: General approaches (what's the first thing you do when you get an error message?)

    1.  restart R 
    2.  check the easy things (have a check list)
        * spelling
        * commas
        * etc.
    3.  run line by line to isolate problem (e.g. pipes, functions, for loops)
    4.  double check documentation (make sure arguments are correct)
    4.  rubber ducky decoding (talk about it out loud)
    3.  GOOGLE (error message, function name, etc.)
        a. Check out function/package source code on GitHub (Jenny Bryan's tweet) -- this could include looking at github issues & pull requests to check if there are known problems with a particular package
        
---
# General apporaches (all)

    1. [r] in front of search phrase or package + search phrase
    2. check dates on stack overflow responses (Danielle's tweet)
    3. read multiple search results. sometimes one explanation will make sense in a way that another explanation may not

# Ways to write good, eas(ier) to debug code

use explaining variables!
